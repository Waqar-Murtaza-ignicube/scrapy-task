This building was originally accessible via a road under the Oudegracht building 227 and one can image it has a rich and long history. The grain warehouse was significantly enlarged to its present size in the second quarter of the 17th century and its destination changed over time. The name ‚ÄòPandhuis'(pawnshop) was given to the building after a bank of loan was established in the property in 1719. In conjunction with this, the original older building Oudegracht 229, renewed in 1764, was used as a home and office connected to the Pandhuis. The fully furnished and equipped serviced apartments inside this lovely building have a modern interior that includes a dining area, comfy sofa, a fully equipped kitchen, a bathroom, a separate toilet, one or two bedrooms with a double bed, and a nice view from the apartment at the front side of the building. Combine the cozy interior with the location in a quiet former monastery garden, in the heart of the city yet away from the daily fuzz of the city, and you have found the perfect location for your short stay experience in Utrecht. The apartments vary from four loft style apartments on the ground floor, to one bedroom apartments and larger two-bedroom units, each of which have been decorated in modern and comfortable style. The Canal Garden Apartment is located on the ground floor. It has a patio attached, which can be accessed from the living room. Public transportation Utrecht Central is the heart of the rail network in the Netherlands and the entrance gate to the city of Utrecht. The network of Utrecht connects the various public transport types: bus, tram, bicycle and train. Utrecht is located in the heart of the Netherlands, therefore all trains will stop here and arrive at the same destination every 15 minutes. From Utrecht Central Station all our apartments are located within 10 minutes walking distance. If you take the bus it will also take you approximately about 10 minutes between our apartments and Utrecht Central Station. Neighborhood From the apartment building one overlooks the garden of the former Regulieren Monastery, hence the apartments name. The first mentioning of this monastery dates back to 1267 AD, which makes the location not only a very nice and quiet place in the heart of the city, but also a location that contributes to the background of Utrecht‚Äôs historical city centre.

The grain warehouse was significantly enlarged to its present size in the second quarter of the 17th century and its destination changed over time. The name ‚ÄòPandhuis'(pawnshop) was given to the building after a bank of loan was established in the property in 1719. In conjunction with this, the original older building Oudegracht 229, renewed in 1764, was used as a home and office connected to the Pandhuis. The fully furnished and equipped serviced apartments inside this lovely building have a modern interior that includes a dining area, comfy sofa, a fully equipped kitchen, a bathroom, a separate toilet, one or two bedrooms with a double bed, and a nice view from the apartment at the front side of the building. Combine the cozy interior with the location in a quiet former monastery garden, in the heart of the city yet away from the daily fuzz of the city, and you have found the perfect location for your (hidden) experience in Utrecht. The apartments vary from four loft style apartments on the ground floor, to one bedroom apartments and larger two-bedroom units, each of which have been decorated in modern and comfortable style. The Canal Garden Apartment 11A is located on the ground floor. It has a patio attached, which can be accessed from the living room.

I have a 110m2 apartment smack in the middle of Rotterdam and have 2 free rooms. I recently moved to Amsterdam with my girlfriend, but still work in Rotterdam, so am keeping the appartment to stay here during the week. I am 29 and have my own company in the data analytics space. On weekdays I'll be out between 8:30 - 17:30 on average, as I work at the office (not remote). During weekends I'll almost always be in Amsterdam. Before moving in together I always had housemates, which was always fun. As a housemate I'm easy going, clean, and like doing things together (cook together, go out for drinks, playing games, etc). I respect people's space and need for alone time too (I also need my alone time from time to time). I like having friends over from time to time, but don't really host any large parties. I'd prefer people that are similar. I have a slight preference for others who are also working full time vs. students, but as long as you're an easy going person, who's also clean, and fun to hang out with from time to time, I'm open to it! About the apartment: It's a 110m2 apartment. The two rooms that are for rent are ~10m2 and ~15m2. Both have a double bed, a wardrobe, a desk, and a chair (note the desk + chair are not in the pictures of 1 room currently, but will be included & can be viewed when visiting the appartment for a viewing). The prices for the rooms are: * ~10m2 room: 1100 EUR per month (this is the ad for the 10m2 room) * ~15m2 room: 1250 EUR per month The apartment is 3 floors, a small entrance at the bottom, 3 bedrooms + a bathroom on the 2nd floor, and a kitchen, living room, sun room (which we have setup as a bar), and large balcony on the 3rd floor. The apartment is fully equipped with kitchen utilities (oven, induction stove, dishwasher, fridge, boiling water tap, wine cooler, coffee machine, plenty of cooking utensils, pans, pots, etc.). I have a home entertainment set with a projector, which includes a Chromecast setup so you can stream Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max etc. There are 2 toilets, one on the top floor, and one on the 2nd floor in the bathroom. The bathroom includes a washing machine and dryer, and has a walk-in rain shower. The rental price is fully inclusive, so it includes: gas, water, electricity, internet (1 GB/s, but most of the time speeds on individual devices max out at about 650 MB/s), building service costs, and a cleaning lady that comes every 2 weeks. You'll be sharing the appartment with 2 others: me & 1 other person. Before making a final choice for housemates I'll try to organize a short introduction so that we can all get to know eachother a bit. Another note: the duration would be max 1 year (shorter is also fine, but min. duration is 3 months and preference would be 1 year). This because I'm not entirely certain myself on whether I'll keep living in the 2nd appartment for longer than that.", "income_requirement": 1100.0, "realtor": "Housing Anywhere", "realtor_link": "https://housinganywhere.com/room/ut1479605/nl/Rotterdam/sint-jacobstraat?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=IamexpatNL&affiliate_partner_id=000446&utm_content=Rotterdam", "website": "https://www.iamexpat.nl/housing/rentals?page=8"},

This house is for a family, OR, for a group that want to live together as a community (Dutch: huishouden). Not for students! Not for party animals! --- Click on ‚Äúshow more‚Äù to read the complete information, including information on the additional costs. --- For those owning a car: the house has a private parking spot, and there is enough parking space in the surrounding neighborhood as well. --- 3D TOUR: A 3D tour of the house can be found on the website of Matterport, copy-paste this URL: https://my.matterport.com/show/?m=CRdk7akWmYE (it works on mobile too). --- COMMUNITY: The housemates in this house live as a co-living community, or in Dutch: \"huishouden\". 'Huishouden' is a requirement of the municipality. This means that either: 1. you are a family (a family is by definition a 'huishouden'). or, 2, the group lives like a community/huishouden, meaning: - the group has the intention to live for a longer term in this house, not just a few months. - the group likes to have dinners with each other (not necessarily every day, but regularly, like in a family). - the group likes to do regularly social activities together, like sometimes visiting a museum, watching a movie, etc. - the group has 1 bank account with the house, for the shared expenses, like energy, gas, and househould costs (salt, pepper, cleaning liquids, etc). - the definition 'huishouden' does not mean that you need to cuddle every night with the housemates on the couch. The things to avoid is distancing: no individualistic people who have completely separated lives and have no idea about their other housemates. The group can keep their own our privacy too, and haves its own jobs, and their own friends; just like in a family: brothers & sisters living together but also having their own lives & own privacy. ‚Äî Lay-out of the house: - Ground floor: Shared toilet, shared living room, shared kitchen and shared garden (for all). - section A: ground floor. 1 bedrooms. - section B: 1st floor: 3 bed rooms. 2 bathrooms. - section C: 2nd floor: 2 bedrooms, 1 bathroom. --- DISTANCES: - in the Netherlands, public transport is in good condition: the connections are great, the reach is far, and the transport is safe. On top of that, the bike is a very popular way of getting around the city, because it is safe and quick. Using the bike is safe, because basically every car road, has a separate bike road \"fietspad\". Just google for yourself \"fietspad\", and you can see the images of a Dutch bike road. A car is hardly used by students, and working people are also using their cars less and less. Even the Dutch prime minster goes by bike to his work! (you can google the images of that too :-) - Supermarkets: Albert Heijn (350 meters), Aldi (800 meters). - Sportclub: Anytime Fitness (300 meters). - Offices at Brainpark area: 26 by bike, 23 by public transport (metro, direct connection) - Erasmus University Rotterdam: 24 min by bike, 23 min by public transport (metro, direct connection). - City Center 'Beurs': 35 min by bike, 23 min by public transport (metro, direct connection). - Offices on Weena area: 35 min by bike, 32 min by public transport (metro, 1 stop over). - Central Train Station: 35 min by bike, 32 min by public transport (metro, 1 stop over). - Erasmus Medical Center MC: 38 min by bike, 24 min by public transport (metro, direct connection). - Codarts, m(hidden)uilding, at street Kruisplein: 33 min by bike, 29 min by public transport (metro, direct connection). - TU Delft: 1h10m by public transport (metro + train) - researchers working at TU Delft, are welcome to live in this house, although it advised to live closer to city Delft, to save you the long travel every day. - Park: there are many small parks around the neighborhood. One of the biggest parks in the Rotterdam region is 7 minutes by bike, called \"het Schollebos\". - North sea beach: 1h10m by metro (point: Hoek van Holland Haven). --- NOT FOR PARTYING: Please note: this neighborhood is a residential neighborhood: your neighbors will be families, so it's a quiet neighborhood. Furthermore, please note that the metro/bus stops operating at 00:30 am. You should take a taxi/uber or the bike back after a night out. Therefore, it is not the right thing to have parties in the house. Partying you can do in the city center. The house is excellent for people that enjoy a quiet environment and a peaceful life. --- EQUIPMENT OF THE BEDROOM: The house is fully furnished and has everything you need for comfortable living/working/studying ! Each bedroom has: - a bed - a closet for your clothes - a bookshelf for your books - a mirror - a desk - a desk chair - bed sheets - towels - bathrobe --- EQUIPMENT OF THE HOUSE: - washing machine - dryer - iron and iron board - fast wifi internet (300down/40up, according to the provider Ziggo, potentially this is a little lower) - living room, with: TV, couch, chair, dining table - kitchen, which is in a corner of the living room. - the kitchen has a microwave, fridge, freezer, oven, stove, dishwasher, pans, cutlery, plates, cups, glasses. - cleaning essentials: vacuum cleaner, bucket, floor brush, etc. (excluding: soaps/liquids and small cleaning material like a sponge and a cloth need to be bought by the tenant). - smoking is not allowed inside the accommodation; smoking is allowed in the garden outside. - garden: there is a backyard garden with a table + chairs. - bike park: you can park your bike in front of the house on the private patio. - outdoor car park: Parking is for free in this neighborhood.

I have a 110m2 apartment smack in the middle of Rotterdam and have 2 free rooms. I recently moved to Amsterdam with my girlfriend, but still work in Rotterdam, so am keeping the appartment to stay here during the week. I am 29 and have my own company in the data analytics space. On weekdays I'll be out between 8:30 - 17:30 on average, as I work at the office (not remote). During weekends I'll almost always be in Amsterdam. Before moving in together I always had housemates, which was always fun. As a housemate I'm easy going, clean, and like doing things together (cook together, go out for drinks, playing games, etc). I respect people's space and need for alone time too (I also need my alone time from time to time). I like having friends over from time to time, but don't really host any large parties. I'd prefer people that are similar. I have a slight preference for others who are also working full time vs. students, but as long as you're an easy going person, who's also clean, and fun to hang out with from time to time, I'm open to it! About the apartment: It's a 110m2 apartment. The two rooms that are for rent are ~10m2 and ~15m2. Both have a double bed, a wardrobe, a desk, and a chair (note the desk + chair are not in the pictures of 1 room currently, but will be included & can be viewed when visiting the appartment for a viewing). The prices for the rooms are: * ~10m2 room: 1100 EUR per month * ~15m2 room: 1150 EUR per month (this is the ad for the 15m2 room) The apartment is 3 floors, a small entrance at the bottom, 3 bedrooms + a bathroom on the 2nd floor, and a kitchen, living room, sun room (which we have setup as a bar), and large balcony on the 3rd floor. The apartment is fully equipped with kitchen utilities (oven, induction stove, dishwasher, fridge, boiling water tap, wine cooler, coffee machine, plenty of cooking utensils, pans, pots, etc.). I have a home entertainment set with a projector, which includes a Chromecast setup so you can stream Netflix, Amazon Prime, HBO Max etc. There are 2 toilets, one on the top floor, and one on the 2nd floor in the bathroom. The bathroom includes a washing machine and dryer, and has a walk-in rain shower. The rental price is fully inclusive, so it includes: gas, water, electricity, internet (1 GB/s, but most of the time speeds on individual devices max out at about 650 MB/s), building service costs, and a cleaning lady that comes every 2 weeks. You'll be sharing the appartment with 2 others: me & 1 other person. Before making a final choice for housemates I'll try to organize a short introduction so that we can all get to know eachother a bit. Another note: the duration would be max 1 year (shorter is also fine, but min. duration is 3 months and preference would be 1 year). This because I'm not entirely certain myself on whether I'll keep living in the 2nd appartment for longer than that.", "income_requirement": 1150.0, "realtor": "Housing Anywhere", "realtor_link": "https://housinganywhere.com/room/ut1204032/nl/Rotterdam/sint-jacobstraat?utm_medium=affiliate&utm_source=IamexpatNL&affiliate_partner_id=000446&utm_content=Rotterdam", "website": "https://www.iamexpat.nl/housing/rentals?page=10"},

In een kamerverhuurpand vlak buiten Amsterdam (Zaandam Poelenburg) komt per 1 augustus 2024 een fijne balkonkamer met 2 extra slaap/werkkamers vrij ter verhuur. Het betreft een kamer van +/- 12 m2 op de 2e etage met priv√© balkon, en op dezelfde etage 2 extra kamers van +/- 10m2. De volledige etage van 3 kamers is hiermee beschikbaar voor 1 persoon van ruim 35m2! Het balkon is over de hele breedte van de kamer en de ligging is op het Zuiden, dus je kunt heerlijk op het balkon overdag zonnen. Het balkon kijkt uit op de rustige groenstrook (dus niet aan de weg kant). De 2e kamer is een lichte kamer met een kiep/kantel raam dat ook volledig open kan. Dit kan als logeerkamer, hobby/werkkamer of voor opslag gebruikt worden. De 3e kamer is ook een lichte kamer met een kiep/kantel raam. Tevens heeft deze kamer een grote inbouwkast, opbergkastjes aan de muur en (indien gewenst) een 1-persoonsbed voor logees. Deze kamer kan als slaapkamer, logeerkamer of hobby/werkkamer gebruikt worden. De 3 kamers zijn met elkaar verbonden via een halletje, waar ook de wasmachine en een opbergkast staat. Alle 3 de kamers zijn met eigen sleutels volledig afsluitbaar. Het pand is verder gelegen in rustige woonwijk van Zaandam. Inschrijving bij de gemeente is mogelijk (verplicht via bereidverklaring). Omgevingsvergunning kamerverhuur + recente omzettingsvergunning is aanwezig en opvraagbaar. Let op, er kan voor deze etage met 3 kamers maar 1 persoon bij de gemeente worden ingeschreven, dus het is niet geschikt voor koppels! Het pand had voorheen 8 bewoners, dit is recentelijk door gemeentebeleid definitief teruggebracht tot 4 personen. De 3 kamers werden voorheen los verhuurd aan 3 verschillende personen voor in totaal ‚Ç¨1900 per maand inclusief servicekosten en gas/water/elektra. Huidige kosten zijn ‚Ç¨995 voor de huur van de 3 kamers en ‚Ç¨300 voor gas, elektriciteit, water, internet en service kosten (‚Ç¨1295 all-in). Het huis heeft verder een gedeelde keuken met 2 koelkasten en ovens, een nieuwe badkamer, losse wc, wasmachine en eettafel met stoelen. In de keuken staat een uitklapbare tafel met 4 stoelen zodat je zelf of met anderen er kunt eten. Een soort woonkeuken dus. Let op, de zolderkamer is gestoffeerd (vloer), dus niet gemeubileerd. De foto‚Äôs met meubilair zijn dus ter illustratie en de kamer wordt leeg opgeleverd. Ook de 2 andere kamers zijn leeg (op kastjes, inbouwkast en eventueel bed na). Het huis heeft een bijzondere goede ligging, er is een directe verbinding met openbaar vervoer richting Amsterdam. De snelbus op enkele minuten lopen gaat via de brugsluis direct via Ring Amsterdam in 15 minuten naar Station Amsterdam Sloterdijk. Ook gaat er een buslijn in slechts 7 minuten naar Zaans Medisch Centrum, en andere bussen naar Zaandam centrum, Zaandam station en rechtstreeks naar Amsterdam Centraal Station. De woning is verder centraal gelegen in woonwijk Poelenburg waar het nog gratis parkeren is. De ligging van de woning is rustig (achter de woning ligt een groenstrook) en zeer centraal, nabij openbaar vervoer, scholen, winkels, meerdere supermarkten en het Darwinpark.

Reminders of that heritage can be found throughout the interior design, a fully equipped, comfortable and conveniently located base from which to discover Amsterdam. Heritage and modern style meet in the unique atmosphere of your place in Amsterdam. The artwork is a reminder of the maritime history of the building. A split-level Duplex Studio for up to two adults and two children is a smart solution for a young family that likes to travel light. The sleeping area in a spacious mezzanine allows for peace and privacy, while a sofa bed in the living room can sleep two children aged 12 or younger.

The apartment is located in Oud-Charlois close to Dokhavenpark and close to the river where you'll have the most amazing views!

It is a nice neighborhood close to the biggest park of Rotterdam: Zuiderpark (see Google Maps). The apartment is situated on the second and third floor of the building.

To give you an idea of the distances: - City Center shopping street \"Koopgoot\": 19min by bike, 35 by public transport - Central Train Station: only 15 min by bike, 35 by public transport - Erasmus Medical Center MC: 10 min by bike, 23 by public transport - Hogeschool Rotterdam, Rochussenstraat: 10 min by bike, 23 by public transport - Hogeschool Rotterdam, Kralingse Zoom: 26 min by bike, 50 by public transport - Erasmus University Rotterdam: 26 min by bike, 50 by public transport - Hogeschool INHolland: 15 min by bike, 25 by public transport --- NOTE 1: for biking to the city center, you will need to bike through the Maastunnel, which is a tunnel below the river. It is a unique experience. The tunnel is open 24/7 and has people assisting in getting down on the escalator. NOTE 2: Registration at the municipality for this address is possible, but in this neighborhood, more strict rules apply than in other areas of Rotterdam; the municipality is doing this to keep the neighborhood in a good condition. You can only register IF: - you are a citizen of the EU - and you earn more than 15.000 euros a year gross, with a job in the Netherlands. -- /OR/ In case of no income: you must prove that you are enrolled at a Dutch university/hogeschool.

The combination of modern and rustic styles, spacious layout, and soothing colors gives, not just the living room, but the whole apartment a homely feel. From the living room you can continue on to the kitchen, enter the patio, or enter the master bedroom through the door on your right. Let‚Äôs start with the master bedroom. Just like every other room in this apartment, the master bedroom bathes in light throughout the day. On your right hand you got a cozy corner with a 140 x 200 bed, wardrobe, and nightstand, while on your left there is another door providing access to the patio and an open bathroom along the side of the patio around the corner. Here, the wooden floor that spans the apartment floor makes way for patterned floor tiles and soft rock grey walls providing a sleek modern/industrial look, while the wooden elements preserve the apartment‚Äôs homely warmth. Yet another door connects the bathroom to the patio as well; the patio is connected to all major areas of the apartment (living room, master bedroom & bathroom, kitchen). Not only does this make it a convenient shortcut for getting around, it also makes airing out the apartment an absolute breeze. Of course, the patio‚Äôs main purpose is to provide you with a place where you can relax in full privacy, have some friends over for drinks, or just replenish your vitamin D. With garden furniture and barbecue all there, you are ready for long summer nights! Crossing the patio to the other side of the apartment you get to the kitchen, where a large wooden dining table and four comfortable chairs await you and your dinner guests. The kitchen is fully equipped with oven, induction plates, fridge, coffee machine, utensils, etc., and several cabinets under the counter provide plenty of storage space. Apart from the doors to the patio and living room, the kitchen also provides access to the last two rooms of the apartment. The door between the sink and fridge leads to another bathroom. Here you‚Äôll find the toilet, another sink, the shower, and the laundry machine. The wooden elements contrasting with the tiled floor and walls continue the warm tones found throughout the apartment. The other door in the kitchen, on the patio side, leads to the second bedroom. The room has a large closet providing more storage space, minimal furniture, and a sink, making it ideal for either a guest room or a home office. Amenities 2 bedrooms | 2 bathrooms | Shower and bathtub | Open patio | Private entrance | Induction plates | Washing machine | Oven | Cooking utensils Things to do in the area ‚Äì suggestions from the owner Ouderkerk aan den IJssel and the surrounding area are beautiful and rich in both history and nature. The 759-years-old village boasts no less than 29 national monuments: traditional Dutch farmhouses, church and cemeteries, and a drawbridge. Surrounded by agriculture, the village lies right at the bank of the river IJssel. A small ferry is available for pedestrians and bicyclists to cross the river to get to Hitland, the nature and leisure park on the other side. Alternatively, you can drive into Rotterdam or Gouda, or go there by public transport as outlined below. Shops Luckily, everything is close in a village, so the nearest grocery store is only 500 meters away from the apartment. The bakery and pizzeria are a little further down the street, although also well within walking distance. Getting around & parking In the entire village parking is free. Behind the apartment building are convenient parking spaces, so you‚Äôll never have to walk far to get to your car in the morning. If you like you can use the private parking place in the private garage as well for your car or store your bike. Public transport There are no trains or trams stopping in Ouderkerk aan den IJssel, so to go anywhere with public transport you‚Äôll need to take a bus. Fortunately, the nearest bus stop is located next to the grocery store, and it will only take you a couple minutes to get there from the apartment. From the bus stop (Burg. Neetstraat), you can take bus 196 to either Rotterdam or Gouda. It will take you about 45 minutes to one hour to get to Rotterdam Centraal (central train station), and about 30 minutes to get to Gouda (train station).
